Shitton of different files, why :'(
	hard to find relevant (macro) defines
	less .h, maybe subdirs for similar .c's?

Norm. because of different editors?

ft_printf_types.h
	what does # pragma mark - enums do
	why use 0b instead of 0x

t_pf_part
	what is conv for? Tells the type to convert to?

fsm:
	init not a real state, just a hub function?
	flag state is actually just init state, [init X {0, ' ', #, +, -, '} -> init]
	width is similar, but Xtreme. Not only [1-9] will go back to width (init) but [0-9].
	same with precis. not only '.', but all of [0-9, '.']. Doesn't go to width.
	leng seems to be just init, [init X {hlfL} -> init].

	not just an fsm, but an fst-ish?
